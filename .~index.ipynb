    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, we are performing statistic tests to determine whether we believe a statement to be true or false. This initial statement we are testing is called the **null hypothesis** One common example of this is whether we believe two populations to be statistically different from one another. For example, we might be interested in testing if a new website layout is more effective in getting customers to make a purchase. In order to determine this, we would compare statistics, such as the average number of purchases in a given day, before and after the change, in order to determine if the new layout was indeed effective.\n",

    "* Explain why alpha = 0.05 is chosen as the cut off point for rejecting Null hypothesis in most scientific experiments\n",
    "* Simulate Type I and Type II errors with alpha control to observe the output of an experiment\n",
    "* Describe and differentiate between TYPE I and TYPE II errors\n",
    "* Understand alpha and beta for representing false positive and false negative values"

    "## Alpha and Type 1 Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting hypothesis testing, we must choose a confidence level, alpha ($\\alpha$) which we will use as the threshold for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis. This confidence level is also the probability that you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about a simple example to make this more understandable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we flip a coin 30 times and get a total of 23 heads. The first thought in your head is, is this a fair coin? With that you create the following null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis:** This coin is fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is assumed to be true unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. To quantify this you must determine what level of confidence for which you will reject the null hypothesis. Traditionally, we set **alpha = .05**. This indicates that there is a 5% chance that we may reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Beta (1-alpha) and Type 2 Errors\n",
    "The compliment to this is beta ($\\beta$), the probability that we accept the null hypothesis when it is actually false. These two errors have a direct relation to each other; reducing type 1 errors will increase type 2 errors and vice versa. "
